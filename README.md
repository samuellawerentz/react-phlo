# React PHLO-UI

This is a minimal version of the PHLO UI that you can find inside Plivo's console. The original PHLO UI was built using Vue2 which is kind of outdated and has complexities to update and maintain code.

This is a simple example or POC of recreating PHLO UI from scratch using react-flow library
